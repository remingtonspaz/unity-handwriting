# unity-handwriting
EMNIST handwriting recognition for Unity using ML-Agents (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and CNN model from https://github.com/Coopss/EMNIST. Might be useful for VR.

## Instructions
- Clone the repo. It's a Unity project with a sample scene.
- The repo includes a version of ML-Agents without examples. If you already have this installed in your own project, you might only want to copy the models, brain, scripts (and optionally prefabs) over.

## About the model
Credits go to https://github.com/Coopss. The models are from https://github.com/Coopss/EMNIST/releases, converted to a format that is compatible with ML-Agents.
